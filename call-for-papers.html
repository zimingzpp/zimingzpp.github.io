            <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to develop Human-Centered AI (HAI) around the core and multidisciplinary nature of Web Science. To discuss in the context of some global challenges such as COVID-19 is the key to embedding a new paradigm of AI into the after-pandemic world. More importantly, Web-based data, structures, and skills should guide AI to enhance our humanity, not to reduce or replace it. </p>
            <p>By this workshop, we hope some sparkles from the world-leading insightful minds that can inspire the participants' research on a new Reasonable, Interpretable, and Human-Centered AI paradigm. Hence building on our theme for 2021, we welcome work that explores the ethics of Web-based data collection and research, such as <b>Data Science, Data Economy, Data Mining, Privacy-Preserving, Anti-Bias Modeling, Machine Learning, Automated Reasoning, Visualization Interactions, Natural Language Processing, Conversational AI, Machine Ethics, Value Alignment, AI Morality</b> and more.</p>
            <p>More broadly, possible topics for submissions include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Have a broader perspective on the Web and that combine analyses of Web data and other types of data (e.g., from surveys or interviews) to better understand user behaviour (i.e., online and offline)</li>
                    <li>Interrogate questions of discrimination, representation, and fairness</li>
                    <li>Ethical challenges of technologies, data, algorithms, platforms, and people in the Web</li>
                    <li>Modeling Web-related structures, data, users and behaviours</li>
                    <li>Impact of AI and machine learning on the development of Web Science</li>
                    <li>Detecting, preventing and predicting anomalies in Web data (e.g., fake content, spam, algorithmic and data biases)</li>
                    <li>Safeguarding and governance of the Web, including anonymity, security and trust</li>
                    <li>Temporal and spatial dimensions of the Web as a repository of information</li>
                    <li>Analysis and modeling of human vs. automatic behaviour (e.g., bots) and their influence on the structure of the Web and responding behaviour</li>
                    <li>Health and well-being online</li>
                    <li>Critical analyses of the Web and Web technologies</li>
                    <li>Web economics, social entrepreneurship, and innovation</li>
                    <li>Analysis of online social and information networks</li>
                    <li>Health, politics, and education on the Web</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Format of the Submissions</h3>
                <p>Language: English</p>
                <p>Please upload your submissions via <b>TBC.</b></p>
                <p>The ACM Web Science Conference will run as an online conference, where authors will present their work remotely to online participants. There is one type of submission: All contributors will submit an abstract (max 400 words) followed by a full paper.</p>
                <p>The authors shall adopt the current ACM SIG Conference proceedings template (acmart.cls). Please submit papers as PDF files using the ACM Submission template (single column). To create your PDF submission, you may use either Microsoft Word format or the ACM LaTeX template on Overleaf (ACM Conference Proceedings “Master” Template) using the “manuscript” option. A full description of the procedure can be found in this link (https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). For the review process, manuscripts should be of approx. 9-13 pages length single column (inclusive of references, appendices, etc.).</p>
                <p>Please note that accepted papers will later be re-formatted with the sigconf style (double column) at camera-ready time. When changing to this style manuscripts may also need to be adjusted to the corresponding final page limit of between 6 and 10 pages (inclusive of references, appendices, etc.).</p>
                <p>All contributions will be judged by the Program Committee upon rigorous peer review standards for quality and fit the conference, by at least three referees. We will adopt a single-blind review process. Do not anonymize your submissions. Submissions without authorship information will be desk-rejected without review.</p>
                <p>For authors who wish to opt-out of publication proceedings, this option will be made available upon acceptance. This will encourage the participation of researchers from the social sciences that prefer to publish their work as journal articles. All authors of accepted papers (including those who opt out of proceedings) are expected to present their work (virtually) at the conference. </p>
